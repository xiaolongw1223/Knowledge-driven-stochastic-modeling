## Research problem formulation

How can subsurface models be constructed using drillholes, outcrop contacts, and airborne geophysics? 

How can experts' geological knowledge be incorporated into the modeling process?

How to quantify the uncertainty of constructed models?

Can constructed models help make informed decisions for subsequent exploratory actions (e.g., where to drill or to collect more geophysical data)?
